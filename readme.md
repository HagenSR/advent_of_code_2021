# advent_of_code 2021 in rust

I'm using [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) to teach myself the rust programming language.

### A lot of this code is bad, with plenty of duplication.

Some of this duplication is because of the problems coming in two parts, where you cannot see the second part until you finish the first.

Also, I'm making a crate for every day, which is probably terrible lol 

### Still need to complete

day 8 part 2
day 12
